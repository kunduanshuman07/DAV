# Project Description :

## Data :
There is a Data.csv file given which consists of around 10000 lines of data with **4 columns (independent variables) namely 'AT' (Ambient Temperature), 'V' (Vaccum), 'AP' (Ambient Pressure) and 'RH' (Humidity)** . It consists of a 5th column (dependent variable or the variable to be predicted) namely **'PE' (Energy)**.

## Problem :

#### Statement : 
Evaluating all the Regression Models Learnt on 'Data.csv'

#### Description :
To predict the dependent variable given using the 4 independent variables by all 5 regression models learnt namely **Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression** and then analyse the performance metrics of all the 5 models and suggest the best one.

### Outcome :

This project on completion will help to get command on the learnings of **Regression A-Z and hands on the ML Model codes**.
Also The 5 Machine Learning Model files so created during the project will be the **actual templates** for all future usage whenever required with only slight changes.
